The amount of points for each question is given in the question text. The total amount of points you can obtain is 50. Your grade at the end can be obtained by dividing the amount of points you scored by 5."

    "### Submission\n",
    "Submit your assignment as a \"zipped\" folder containing this Jupyter notebook, the `assets` directory, and all the pictures that you have included into your Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packages\n",
    "You are allowed to use only the packages that are imported at the start of the questions. If you want to use any other package, you need to ask for explicit permission. However, note that you will be able to do the assignment with only the packages below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "For each question, your answer may require a written text answer, an image, a piece of code, or a combination of these. Below is a short overview of how to include specific things in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Syntax, Headings\n",
    "Text blocks use the _Markdown_ syntax. By default, Markdown produces the text you write in a Markdown block as regular text. To use bold text, enclose the part in asterisks (**), and for italics, use underscores (_). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "**this piece of text is bold**\n",
    "_this is in italics_\n",
    "this is regular text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you may want to use headings in your document. Headings are made using the #-character as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "# Level 1 heading\n",
    "## Level 2 heading\n",
    "### Level 3 heading\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Images\n",
    "For some questions, you may need to insert an image. You can save the image on your computer in the `assets` folder, also located in the assignment files. Imagine you put your image named `answer-question-1.png` in the `assets` folder, and you then want to include the image in your markdown document. This can be done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "![alt text](assets/answer-question-1.png)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equations\n",
    "If you want to type mathematical equations, you can use single dollar signs `$` to write inline math. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "$x^3 + x^2 - 4 = 0$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Renders as: $x^3 + x^2 - 4 = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "For centered, large equations, you can use double dollar signs `$$`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```md\n",
    "$$\\int_0^3 x \\mathrm{d}x$$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Renders as: $$\\int_0^3 x \\mathrm{d}x$$"
